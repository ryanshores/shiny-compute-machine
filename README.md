# shiny-compute-machine

This project is a collection of services that I have found useful to run on a local network. The intent is to provide a simple way to get a local network up and running with a few services that can be used to augment your network.

## Services

- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)
- [Technitium DNS Server](https://technitium.com/dns/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/)
- [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
